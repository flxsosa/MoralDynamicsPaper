# MoralDynamicsPaper

This repo contains all material for the paper "Moral Dynamics: Grounding Moral Judgment in Intuitive Physics and Intuitive Psychology" by Sosa, FA, et al. Please contact me if you have any questions.

### Abstract

When holding others morally responsible, we care about what they did, and what they thought. Traditionally, research in moral psychology has relied on vignette studies, in which a protagonist's actions and thoughts are explicitly communicated. While this research has revealed what variables are important for moral judgment, such as actions and intentions, it is limited in providing a more detailed understanding of exactly how these variables affect moral judgment. Using visual stimuli that allow for a more fine-grained experimental control, recent studies have proposed a direct mapping from visual features to moral judgments. We embrace the use of visual stimuli in moral psychology, but question the plausibility of a feature-based theory of moral judgment. We propose that the connection from visual features to moral judgments is mediated by an inference about what the observed action reveals about the agent's mental states. We present a computational model that formalizes moral judgments of agents in visual scenes, as computations over an intuitive theory of physics combined with an intuitive theory of mind. Knowing what mental states lead to actions, and that these actions are constrained by physics, allows an observer to make powerful inferences about moral responsibility. Two experiments show that this model captures moral judgments about visual scenes, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
